        I’m excited to apply for the Software Engineering Intern position at
        Google. With a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for
        solving complex problems, I’m eager to contribute to impactful projects
        involving large-scale systems, AI, and NLP. I thrive in fast-paced,
        collaborative environments and look forward to working on real-world
        challenges— whether it’s building scalable solutions, researching new
        technologies, or improving user experiences. I'm available immediately
        and motivated to grow as an engineer while contributing to Google’s
        mission.
